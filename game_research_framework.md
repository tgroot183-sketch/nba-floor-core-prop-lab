# NBA Game Research Framework & Floor-Core Philosophy

To analyze a game effectively, you need to collect information from multiple angles rather than relying solely on a single statistic or narrative. This checklist reflects how scouts and analysts build a game script and identify stable prop edges.

## Non-negotiable principle: minutes drive everything

If minutes are unstable, every projection becomes noise. Before you touch any prop, decide whether a player’s minutes are predictable (role, rotation, health, game context). Minutes are the engine; usage and matchup are the tuning knobs.

## Research checklist

### Injury Report, Availability, and Minutes Risk

Identify who is out, doubtful/questionable, or returning with a minutes restriction. Availability changes rotations, which changes minutes, pace, usage, and who closes.

**Rule:** if a player is questionable, on a minutes cap, or in a “first game back” spot, treat them as high variance and exclude from conservative plays.

### Game Type and Stakes (Regular Season vs Cup vs Playoffs)

Always label the game type because it changes rotations and minutes:

- NBA Cup / tournament-style games: coaches shorten rotations more often; stars close harder; intensity rises.
- Playoffs: minutes tighten, bench roles shrink, matchup hunting increases, and foul trouble matters more.
- Must-win / seeding / rivalry: similar effect—more starter minutes, fewer experimental lineups.
- Low-stakes spots: more rest risk, more bench time, more volatility.

**Rule:** higher stakes generally increases minutes certainty for stars and decreases minutes certainty for fringe rotation players.

### Team Efficiency and Game Script Inputs

Review:

- Offensive Rating / Defensive Rating (per 100 possessions)
- Pace (possessions per game)
- Four Factors: eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTr

These define expected scoring environment and possession quality. Use them to shape likely script (fast shootout vs slow grind) and flag where each team wins/loses possessions.

### Player Roles, Usage, and Touch Profile

Classify roles (primary handler, secondary creator, hub big, catch-and-shoot wing, rim runner, etc.). Identify how they generate production (PnR, iso, spot-ups, post). Usage rate and assist rate help estimate combination-stat stability, but only after minutes are stable.

### Matchups and Individual Defense

Project likely matchups (who guards whom) and identify mismatch risks (size, foul tendency, elite stoppers). Use this to adjust ceiling/efficiency expectations—not to override minutes.

### Historical Trends and Recent Form (with minutes context)

Review last 5–10 games:

- Minutes
- Production
- Shooting splits

Separate sustainable changes (role/minutes shift, rotation change) from noise (foul trouble, overtime, blowouts, injury game). Also check performance vs similar opponent styles (fast vs slow, elite rim protection vs small ball).

### Schedule, Travel, and Fatigue

Back-to-backs, 3-in-4s, travel, altitude. Fatigue can reduce pace, efficiency, and sometimes minutes—especially for older players.

### Home/Away and Venue Factors

Check meaningful splits, but treat them as secondary. The main question remains: will the coach play him his normal minutes?

### Line Movement and Market Info

Monitor spread/total movement and sudden shifts (often injury/news-driven). Use the market to sanity-check your game script and minutes assumptions.

### Officiating Crew Tendencies (Referees, Stats, and History)

Referee crews can materially change foul volume and game flow. Pull crew-specific history and compare it to league baselines:

- Fouls per game
- Free-throw attempts per game (and FT differential if available)
- Home/away foul or FT skew
- Technical foul frequency
- Stoppage/replay tendency (rhythm/pace impact)
- Team/player history with the crew (small sample—use as a flag, not the thesis)

**How to use ref data correctly:**

- Treat refs as a small multiplier, not the main reason for a play.
- High-foul crews can raise the floor for FTA-driven scorers and increase foul-trouble minutes risk for bigs/physical defenders.
- Low-foul crews can reduce easy points and increase physical variance.

## How to apply it (prop workflow)

1. Label the game type (regular season / Cup / playoffs) + confirm injuries.
2. Decide who has stable minutes. If minutes aren’t predictable, stop.
3. Use team metrics to define the script (pace + scoring environment).
4. Apply matchup + refs as secondary modifiers (especially foul/FT and foul-trouble minutes risk).
5. Target floor-friendly props: alt-overs 2–4 units below the main line, driven by role + minutes more than shooting luck.
6. Track results and recalibrate: implied probability vs your estimated hit rate.

## Conservative core rules

- No rookies / no small-sample roles. High-variance players are “upside only,” not floor.
- Only use veterans with ~25+ games in the same role and stable minutes.
- Only play their main role stat:
  - Bigs → rebounds
  - Primary ball-handlers → assists (or RA/PRA if that’s their true output)
  - Stable volume scorers → points (or PRA if role is truly balanced)

---

## Exact stat projection definition (narrowed down)

**Stat type:** One primary role stat per player (REB for bigs, AST for primary ball-handlers, PTS for stable volume scorers).

**Projection – Floor Projection (20th percentile):**  
The highest number in that stat they clear in at least 4 out of 5 normal-minute games (≈80%+).

That is the exact projection: one stat type, one floor number, anchored to normal minutes, with game type/stakes and refs used as disciplined secondary adjustments (primarily via minutes certainty, foul/FT environment, and foul-trouble risk).
